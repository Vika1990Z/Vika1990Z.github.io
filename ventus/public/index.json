	"content": " On this page, you can find an explanation of what is Object Storage in Cloud Console, how to create, delete buckets and instructions for other steps to manage an Object Storage in Cloud Console.\nTable of contents  Introduction Use Object Storage with Python API  Creating connection Listing owned buckets Creating bucket Creating object Listing bucket\u0026rsquo;s content Changing object\u0026rsquo;s ACL Generating object\u0026rsquo;s download-URL Deleting object Deleting a bucket   Use Object Storage with S3 Browser  Introduction The Cloud Console Object Storage makes it possible to store data simply and cost-effectively. It provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly into applications or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.\nIt’s built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire data set. An Object Storage API differs from a conventional filesystem: instead of directories and files, you manipulate containers where you store objects. A container can hold millions of objects.\nThere is no notion of hierarchy with containers: you cannot nest a container within another, however, you can emulate a nested folder structure with a naming convention for your objects.\nBefore we start to configure and use Object Storage we need to create credentials that include the access key and secret key. To find instructions of how to create Object Storage Credentials in Cloud Console, please, see the article - Object Storage Credentials\nUse Object Storage with Python API Python support is provided through a fork of the boto3 library with features to make the most of Cloud Console Object Storage. To start use the Object Storage with the Python API do the following:\n install boto library by running the command:\npip install boto   NOTE: As well as Python API you can select other programming languages for using the Object Storage.\n Now let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at each block of code to deal with possible interactions with Object Storage via the Python API:\nCreating connection To create a connection for interacting with the server use next block of code:\nimport boto import boto.s3.connection s3_access_key = \u0026#39;**your_access_key**\u0026#39; s3_secret_key = \u0026#39;**your_secret_key**\u0026#39; s3_host = \u0026#39;**upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu** conn = boto.connect_s3( aws_access_key_id=s3_access_key, aws_secret_access_key=s3_secret_key, host=s3_host, port=8080, calling_format=boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat(), ) Remember to replace the your_access_key and your_secret_key part with your credential information, and also check if the s3_host is correct - if it matches the correct Region.\nCreating bucket To create a new Bucket use the next block of code:\nbucket = conn.create_bucket(\u0026#39;**1-bucket-using-python**\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#34;New bucket created:\\n{bucket_name}\\t{bucket}\u0026#34;) The 1-bucket-using-python is the name of the new bucket, please enter the desired name for your bucket here.\nListing owned buckets To get a list of Buckets that you own use the next block of code:\nfor bucket in conn.get_all_buckets(): print (\u0026#34;{name}\\t{created}\u0026#34;.format( name = bucket.name, created = bucket.creation\\_date, )) It also prints out the bucket name and creation date of each bucket.\nCreating object To create a new object in the bucket use the next block of code:\nkey = bucket.new_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) key.set_contents_from_string(\u0026#39;Hello World!\u0026#39;) key = bucket.new_key(\u0026#39;private_info.txt\u0026#39;) key.set_contents_from_filename(\u0026#39;/home/usr/private_data.txt\u0026#39;) So, it creates a file \u0026lsquo;hello.txt\u0026rsquo; with the string \u0026ldquo;Hello World!\u0026rdquo; and a file \u0026lsquo;private_info.txt\u0026rsquo; with the data from the local file.\nListing bucket\u0026rsquo;s content To list a bucket\u0026rsquo;s content use the next block of code:\nfor key in bucket.list(): print \u0026#34;{name}\\t{size}\\t{modified}\u0026#34;.format( name = key.name, size = key.size, modified = key.last_modified, ) It also prints out the object name, size and creation date of each object.\nChanging object\u0026rsquo;s ACL  ACL = access control lists\n To make objects to be publicly readable or to be private, use the next block of code:\nhello_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) hello_key.set_canned_acl(\u0026#39;public-read\u0026#39;) private_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;private_info.txt\u0026#39;) private_key.set_canned_acl(\u0026#39;private\u0026#39;) So, this code makes the object \u0026lsquo;hello.txt\u0026rsquo; to be publicly readable, and the object \u0026lsquo;private_info.txt\u0026rsquo; to be private.\nGenerating object download URL For publicly readable objects we can generate an unsigned download URL.\nTo do this use the next block code:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) hello_url = hello_key.generate_url(0, query_auth=False, force_http=False) print (hello_url) For private objects we can generate a signed download URL that will work for the time period (when the time period is up, the URL will stop working).\nTo do this use the next block code:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;private_data.txt\u0026#39;) private_url = private_key.generate_url(3600, query_auth=True, force_http=False) print (private_url) Please, notice here, when a client application accesses buckets, it always operates with the credentials of a particular user. As every user belongs to a particular project, therefore, for using this links you should add your project ID before your bucket name, and the working links in both examples will look like this: for publicly readable objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/**Your_Project_ID:**new-bucket-using-python/hello.txt\u0026rdquo;;\nfor private objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/**Your_Project_ID:**new-bucket-using-python/private_info.txt?Signature=XXX\u0026amp;Expires=1316027075\u0026amp;AWSAccessKeyId=XXX\u0026rdquo;\nFind your Project ID you can:\n  on the Projects page in Cloud Console:   in the link, when you use Cloud Console:   Deleting object To delete an object from the bucket use the next code block:\nbucket.delete_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) It deletes a file \u0026ldquo;hello.txt\u0026rdquo; from the bucket.\nDeleting bucket To delete a whole bucket use the next code block:\nconn.delete_bucket(\u0026#34;**1-bucket-using-python\u0026#34;**) It deletes the whole bucket called \u0026ldquo;1-bucket-using-python\u0026rdquo;.\nUse Object Storage with S3 Browser The S3 Browser is another way how we can use the Cloud Console Object Storage and manage data stored in it.\nTo download and install it on your computer, go to the next page https://s3browser.com/.\nAfter installation, you can open on your computer S3 Browser and see the next interface of this program: To start work with the Cloud Console Object Storage provide your credential information, for this do the following:\n on the main Navigation Panel go to Accounts, choose Add new account:  fill in fields on the following page as shown below press Add new account:   After these steps, a connection to the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 browser is established and you can see all owned buckets and to manage them:\n To add a new bucket or delete a bucket just by clicking on the one of the buttons:  To make bucket public or private go to Permissions tab and select the necessary option:   So, as you can see, using the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 Browser is as easy as using programming languages.\n"

	"content": " On this page, you can find an explanation of how to connect to the Linux Virual Machine created in Cloud Console using SSH Protocol\nTable of contents  Prerequisites Configuring Firewalls Connect using SSH  Prerequisites In this article, we will assume that we have already created the following resources, that refer to the Project named dev1 that was created in the Organization named Test-Shop:\n SSH Key, that was created with the next parameters:  Name: mykey; Public key is placed on the Linux VM during its creation; Private Key was copied to the clipboard and saved on the local system in the next text file (for example: ~/.ssh/id_rsa).   Linux Virtual Machine - that was created with the next parameters and has IP: 185.226.41.42:  Name: test-1; Flavor: VC-2; Image: ubuntu-server-18.04-LTS-20201111; Key pair: mykey; Networks: public; Firewalls: default; Volume size: 10.    For more information on creating and configuring these resources, see the following articles:\nSSh Keys Virtual Machines\nConfiguring Firewalls By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall. Thus, using only the default Firewall, we cannot connect to the selected Virtual Machine remotely via SSH.\n NOTE: Default Firewall allows all outbound traffic and controls the inbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to reach the VMs that are associated with the default Firewall too.  To resolve this, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. To create new Firewall do the following:\n open the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB:   on the Firewalls page click on the CREATE FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall window and click on the CREATE icon:   To add the described above rule to the newly created Firewall do the following:\n  open the Firewall Rules page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall:   on the Firewall Rules page you can see that rules, that allow all outbound traffic, have been already created by default, and to add additional rule here click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner:   fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon:   This newly added rule will allow access to the TCP port 22 on the all VMs in the created Firewall over the public Internet, but if you want to allow access only on the one selected VM you need to specify IP of this VM / 32 in the field named Remote IP prefix - example is shown below: To add this newly created Firewall to our Virtual Machine, do the following:\n  open the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block:   open the Virtual Machine details page - click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine:   open the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB and click on the ADD FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner of the opened page:   select our newly created firewall on the following Add firewall window and click on the ADD icon:   This is the first option, how we can configure the Firewall for SSH access - by creating a new one with the required rule. But we can just add this rule to the default Firewall that is already assigned to our VM, and these changes will automatically be applied to the VMs.  NOTE: You can add and remove rules at any time. Your changes are automatically applied to the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\n To add required rule to the default Firewall you need to do next:\n  open the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB:   open the Firewall Rules page of the default Firewall- for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall:   on the Firewall Rules page click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner;\n  fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon:   And that\u0026rsquo;s all, this newly created Firewall Rule will be automatically applied to our Virtual Machine.\nConnect using SSH Since we have the public key deployed on our Linux VM, the private key on our local system (for example ~/.ssh/id_rsa) and a Firewall configured to allow incoming traffic on port 22, we can connect to this Virtual Machine remotely from our local server via SSH, just use the next command: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@*10.111.22.333*\n NOTE: Username for VMs created with Ubuntu image will be ubuntu;\nwith Centos image - centos.\n Replace username and 10.11.22.333 in the command with your data and specify the appropriate path to your private key. In our example, the command will look like this: sudo ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@185.226.41.42 After successfully connecting, you can check your internet access and try pinging google.com: "
