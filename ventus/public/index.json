	"content": " On this page, you can find an explanation of what is Object Storage in Cloud Console, how to create, delete buckets and instructions for other steps to manage an Object Storage in Cloud Console.\nTable of contents  Introduction Use Object Storage with Python API  Creating connection Listing owned buckets Creating bucket Creating object Listing bucket\u0026rsquo;s content Changing object\u0026rsquo;s ACL Generating object\u0026rsquo;s download-URL Deleting object Deleting a bucket   Use Object Storage with S3 Browser  Introduction The Cloud Console Object Storage makes it possible to store data simply and cost-effectively. It provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform that can be integrated directly into applications or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.\nIt’s built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire data set. An Object Storage API differs from a conventional filesystem: instead of directories and files, you manipulate containers where you store objects. A container can hold millions of objects.\nThere is no notion of hierarchy with containers: you cannot nest a container within another, however, you can emulate a nested folder structure with a naming convention for your objects.\nBefore we start to configure and use Object Storage we need to create credentials that include the access key and secret key. To find instructions of how to create Object Storage Credentials in Cloud Console, please, see the article - Object Storage Credentials\nUse Object Storage with Python API Python support is provided through a fork of the boto3 library with features to make the most of Cloud Console Object Storage. To start use the Object Storage with the Python API do the following:\n install boto library by running the command:\npip install boto  As well as Python API you can select other programming languages for using the Object Storage.\n Now let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at each block of code to deal with possible interactions with Object Storage via the Python API:\nCreating connection To create a connection for interacting with the server use next block of code:\nimport boto import boto.s3.connection s3_access_key = \u0026#39;**your_access_key**\u0026#39; s3_secret_key = \u0026#39;**your_secret_key**\u0026#39; s3_host = \u0026#39;**upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu** conn = boto.connect_s3( aws_access_key_id=s3_access_key, aws_secret_access_key=s3_secret_key, host=s3_host, port=8080, calling_format=boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat(), ) Remember to replace the your_access_key and your_secret_key part with your credential information, and also check if the s3_host is correct - if it matches the correct Region.\nCreating bucket To create a new Bucket use the next block of code:\nbucket = conn.create_bucket(\u0026#39;**1-bucket-using-python**\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#34;New bucket created:\\n{bucket_name}\\t{bucket}\u0026#34;) The 1-bucket-using-python is the name of the new bucket, please enter the desired name for your bucket here.\nListing owned buckets To get a list of Buckets that you own use the next block of code:\nfor bucket in conn.get_all_buckets(): print (\u0026#34;{name}\\t{created}\u0026#34;.format( name = bucket.name, created = bucket.creation\\_date, )) It also prints out the bucket name and creation date of each bucket.\nCreating object To create a new object in the bucket use the next block of code:\nkey = bucket.new_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) key.set_contents_from_string(\u0026#39;Hello World!\u0026#39;) key = bucket.new_key(\u0026#39;private_info.txt\u0026#39;) key.set_contents_from_filename(\u0026#39;/home/usr/private_data.txt\u0026#39;) So, it creates a file \u0026lsquo;hello.txt\u0026rsquo; with the string \u0026ldquo;Hello World!\u0026rdquo; and a file \u0026lsquo;private_info.txt\u0026rsquo; with the data from the local file.\nListing bucket\u0026rsquo;s content To list a bucket\u0026rsquo;s content use the next block of code:\nfor key in bucket.list(): print \u0026#34;{name}\\t{size}\\t{modified}\u0026#34;.format( name = key.name, size = key.size, modified = key.last_modified, ) It also prints out the object name, size and creation date of each object.\nChanging object\u0026rsquo;s ACL  ACL = access control lists\n To make objects to be publicly readable or to be private, use the next block of code:\nhello_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) hello_key.set_canned_acl(\u0026#39;public-read\u0026#39;) private_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;private_info.txt\u0026#39;) private_key.set_canned_acl(\u0026#39;private\u0026#39;) So, this code makes the object \u0026lsquo;hello.txt\u0026rsquo; to be publicly readable, and the object \u0026lsquo;private_info.txt\u0026rsquo; to be private.\nGenerating object download URL For publicly readable objects we can generate an unsigned download URL.\nTo do this use the next block code:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) hello_url = hello_key.generate_url(0, query_auth=False, force_http=False) print (hello_url) For private objects we can generate a signed download URL that will work for the time period (when the time period is up, the URL will stop working).\nTo do this use the next block code:\nprivate_key = bucket.get_key(\u0026#39;private_data.txt\u0026#39;) private_url = private_key.generate_url(3600, query_auth=True, force_http=False) print (private_url) Please, notice here, when a client application accesses buckets, it always operates with the credentials of a particular user. As every user belongs to a particular project, therefore, for using this links you should add your project ID before your bucket name, and the working links in both examples will look like this: for publicly readable objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/**Your_Project_ID:**new-bucket-using-python/hello.txt\u0026rdquo;;\nfor private objects - \u0026ldquo;https://upper-austria.ventuscloud.eu:8080/**Your_Project_ID:**new-bucket-using-python/private_info.txt?Signature=XXX\u0026amp;Expires=1316027075\u0026amp;AWSAccessKeyId=XXX\u0026rdquo;\nFind your Project ID you can:\n  on the Projects page in Cloud Console:   in the link, when you use Cloud Console:   Deleting object To delete an object from the bucket use the next code block:\nbucket.delete_key(\u0026#39;hello.txt\u0026#39;) It deletes a file \u0026ldquo;hello.txt\u0026rdquo; from the bucket.\nDeleting bucket To delete a whole bucket use the next code block:\nconn.delete_bucket(\u0026#34;**1-bucket-using-python\u0026#34;**) It deletes the whole bucket called \u0026ldquo;1-bucket-using-python\u0026rdquo;.\nUse Object Storage with S3 Browser The S3 Browser is another way how we can use the Cloud Console Object Storage and manage data stored in it.\nTo download and install it on your computer, go to the next page https://s3browser.com/.\nAfter installation, you can open on your computer S3 Browser and see the next interface of this program: To start work with the Cloud Console Object Storage provide your credential information, for this do the following:\n on the main Navigation Panel go to Accounts, choose Add new account:  fill in fields on the following page as shown below press Add new account:   After these steps, a connection to the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 browser is established and you can see all owned buckets and to manage them:\n To add a new bucket or delete a bucket just by clicking on the one of the buttons:  To make bucket public or private go to Permissions tab and select the necessary option:   So, as you can see, using the Cloud Console Object Storage through the S3 Browser is as easy as using programming languages.\n"

	"content": " On this page, you can find an explanation of how to connect to the Linux Virual Machine created in Cloud Console using SSH Protocol\nTable of contents  Prerequisites Configuring Firewalls Connect using SSH  Prerequisites In this article, we will assume that we have already created the following resources, that refer to the Project named dev1 that was created in the Organization named Test-Shop:\n SSH Key, that was created with the next parameters:  Name: mykey; Public key is placed on the Linux VM during its creation; Private Key was copied to the clipboard and saved on the local system in the next text file (for example: ~/.ssh/id_rsa).   Linux Virtual Machine - that was created with the next parameters and has IP: 185.226.41.42:  Name: test-1; Flavor: VC-2; Image: ubuntu-server-18.04-LTS-20201111; Key pair: mykey; Networks: public; Firewalls: default; Volume size: 10.    For more information on creating and configuring these resources, see the following articles:\nSSh Keys Virtual Machines\nConfiguring Firewalls By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall. Thus, using only the default Firewall, we cannot connect to the selected Virtual Machine remotely via SSH.\n Default Firewall allows all outbound traffic and controls the inbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to reach the VMs that are associated with the default Firewall too.\n To resolve this, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. To create new Firewall do the following:\n open the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB:   on the Firewalls page click on the CREATE FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall window and click on the CREATE icon:   To add the described above rule to the newly created Firewall do the following:\n  open the Firewall Rules page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall:   on the Firewall Rules page you can see that rules, that allow all outbound traffic, have been already created by default, and to add additional rule here click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner:   fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon:   This newly added rule will allow access to the TCP port 22 on the all VMs in the created Firewall over the public Internet, but if you want to allow access only on the one selected VM you need to specify IP of this VM / 32 in the field named Remote IP prefix - example is shown below: To add this newly created Firewall to our Virtual Machine, do the following:\n  open the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block:   open the Virtual Machine details page - click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine:   open the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB and click on the ADD FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner of the opened page:   select our newly created firewall on the following Add firewall window and click on the ADD icon:   This is the first option, how we can configure the Firewall for SSH access - by creating a new one with the required rule. But we can just add this rule to the default Firewall that is already assigned to our VM, and these changes will automatically be applied to the VMs. You can add and remove rules at any time. Your changes are automatically applied to the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\n To add required rule to the default Firewall you need to do next:\n  open the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB:   open the Firewall Rules page of the default Firewall- for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall:   on the Firewall Rules page click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner;\n  fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon:   And that\u0026rsquo;s all, this newly created Firewall Rule will be automatically applied to our Virtual Machine.\nConnect using SSH Since we have the public key deployed on our Linux VM, the private key on our local system (for example ~/.ssh/id_rsa) and a Firewall configured to allow incoming traffic on port 22, we can connect to this Virtual Machine remotely from our local server via SSH, just use the next command: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@*10.111.22.333*\nUsername for VMs created with Ubuntu image will be ubuntu;\nwith Centos image - centos.\n Replace username and 10.11.22.333 in the command with your data and specify the appropriate path to your private key. In our example, the command will look like this: sudo ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@185.226.41.42 After successfully connecting, you can check your internet access and try pinging google.com: "

Thus, using only the default Firewall, we cannot connect to the selected Virtual Machine remotely via SSH.\nDefault Firewall allows all outbound traffic and controls the inbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to reach the VMs that are associated with the default Firewall too.  To resolve this, we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 54000 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. To create new Firewall do the following:\n open the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB:   on the Firewalls page click on the CREATE FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall window and click on the CREATE icon:   To add the described above rule to the newly created Firewall do the following:\n  open the Firewall Rules page - for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall:   on the Firewall Rules page you can see that rules, that allow all outbound traffic, have been already created by default, and to add additional rule here click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner:   fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon:   This newly added rule will allow access to the TCP port 54000 on the all VMs in the created Firewall over the public Internet, but if you want to allow access only on the one selected VM you need to specify IP of this VM / 32 in the field named Remote IP prefix - example is shown below: To add this newly created Firewall to our Virtual Machine, do the following:\n  open the Virtual Machines page - for this select the Virtual Machines from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block:   open the Virtual Machine details page - click on the Name of the corresponding Virtual Machine:   click on the NETWORKS \u0026amp; SECURITY TAB and click on the ADD FIREWALL icon in the upper left corner of the opened page:   select our newly created firewall on the following Add firewall window and click on the ADD icon:   This is the first option, how we can configure the Firewall for RDP access - by creating a new one with the required rule. But we can just add this rule to the default Firewall that is already assigned to our VM, and these changes will automatically be applied to the VMs.\nYou can add and remove rules at any time. Your changes are automatically applied to the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall.\n To add required rule to the default Firewall you need to do next:\n  open the Firewalls page - for this select the Security from the VIRTUAL DATACENTER block and click on the FIREWALL TAB:   open the Firewall Rules page of the default Firewall- for this click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall:   on the Firewall Rules page click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner;\n  fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window as shown below and click on the CREATE icon:   And that\u0026rsquo;s all, this newly created Firewall Rule will be automatically applied to our Virtual Machine.\nConnect using RDP Since we have created Windows Virtual Machine and configured Firewall that allows incoming traffic to TCP port 54000, so we can connect to the selected Virtual Machine remotely via RDP.\nFor this do the following:\n download RDP file of the VM:  identify Windows Virtual Machine for what you want to download RDP file on the Virtual Machines page; click on the Actions icon and select the Download RDP file in the list of available options:    open the downloaded RDP file; provide the password of the selected VM and click OK:   And after these steps, a remote connection is established to the selected Windows virtual machine: "

	"content": " On this page, you can find an explanation of how to create, delete Firewall Rules and instructions for other steps to manage Firewall Rules in Cloud Console.\nTable of contents  Firewall Rules page Characteristics of Firewall Rules Create Firewall Rule Firewall Rule details page Delete Firewall Rule Firewall Rule for SSH Protocol Firewall Rule for SSH Protocol  Firewall Rules page To get to the Firewall Rules page click on the Name of the corresponding Firewall on the Firewalls page: On this page you can find:\n panel with available quick actions for the selected Firewall:  all Rules related to the selected Firewall with their Headers, Create button, Search bar and Actions icon, which opens a list of available management actions for the selected Rule:   Actions icon opens the next list of available management actions for the selected Rule:\n Delete - this option is for Firewall Rule deletion.  After creating a new Firewall, two rules have been automatically added to the Firewall Rules page - the default rules that allow all outgoing traffic. You can remove them if needed.\nFirewall Rules Characteristics Firewall Rules control the inbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to reach the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall. The rules also control the outbound traffic that\u0026rsquo;s allowed to leave them.\nFirewall Rules have the following characteristics:\n By default, Firewalls allow all outbound traffic. Firewall Rules are always permissive; you can\u0026rsquo;t create rules that deny access. Firewall Rules enable you to filter traffic based on protocols and port numbers. You can add and remove rules at any time. Your changes are automatically applied to the VMs that are associated with the corresponding Firewall. You can assign multiple Firewalls to the VMs. The rules from each Firewall are effectively aggregated to create one set of rules, but we recommend that you condense your rules as much as possible.  Create Firewall Rule To create new Firewall Rule do the following:\n go to the Firewall Rules page and click on the CREATE FIREWALL RULE icon in the upper left corner; fill in the form on the next opened Create Firewall Rule window:  Description - set a description for the Rule; Direction - select a direction for the Rule: ingress or egress; Protocol - select the type of protocol for the Rule: TCP, UDP, ICMP; Port options - this field is available only for rules with TCP and UDP protocols; select one of the option, that you will provide below:  Port - use this option, if your rule will be for one specific port; Port range - use this option, if your rule will be for some specific port range; All Ports - use this option, if your rule will be for all ports between 0 and 65535.   Remote - select one of the option, that you will provide below:  Firewall - use this option, if you want to apply this rule for the another Firewall; the selected Firewall will be associated with this rule; CIDR - use this option, if you want to apply this rule for the IP Addresses range.      After these steps, the newly created Firewall Rule will be added to the Firewall Rules page Firewall Rule details page To get to the Firewall Rule details page click on the ID of the corresponding Firewall Rule: On this page you can find additional information about this Rule and quick actions icon for rule deletion: Delete Firewall Rule To delete a Firewall Rule do the following:\n identify this unnecessary Rule on the Firewall Rule page; click on the Actions icon and select the Delete in the list of available options; confirm the Firewall Rule deletion on the next opened Confirmation window.  After these steps, the selected Firewall Rule will be deleted.\nAlso, you can delete the rule from Firewall Rule details page, by clicking on the appropriative quick actions icon there.\nFirewall Rule for SSH Protocol By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall.\nThus, to open connection to the selected Linux Virtual Machine remotely via SSH we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 22 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine.\nExample of such rule you can see below: To find more information about how to connect to the Linux Virual Machine created in Cloud Console using SSH Protocol, please use the article - Connect Linux VM\nFirewall Rule for RDP By default, all created Virtual Machines belong to the default Firewall, which allows access to the Internet from the VM, but denies almost all access on the VM from outside, except for objects belonging to the same default Firewall.\nThus, to open connection to the selected Windows Virtual Machine remotely via RDP we need to add an additional Firewall with a rule that will allow incoming traffic to TCP port 54000 on the Virtual Machines and assign this Firewall to the VM too, or just add the required rule to the Firewall that is already assigned to the Virtual Machine. Example of such rule you can see below: To find more information about how to connect to the Windows Virtual Machine created in Cloud Console using Remote Desktop Protocol, please, use the article - Connect Windows VM \n"

Basic Linux and Networking skills are required. Please contact support if you need guidance and best practices for your specific use case.\nMost of the features described below are in beta state, thus not available at the Console portal, and can be configured through CLI and IaC tools like Terraform and Ansible.\n Table of contents  Prerequisites Port Migration Floating IP Load Balancer  Prerequisites  CLI User created. To find more detailed instructions see the article - CLI Users. Openstack Client Configured. To find more detailed instructions see the article - Installation OpenStack CLI.  Port Migration Port migration can be used in drop-in replacement of instances in case of major software upgrades or recovery scenarios, especially when you need to preserve initial networking settings and you didn\u0026rsquo;t plan for such actions in advance by leveraging Floating IPs or Load Balancers.\nScenarios:\n Install and configure new instance nearby to old one, verify internally that it works as expected and then switch production traffic to it with preserving ability to rollback to previous version (instance). In case of major failures - restore instance from backup and leverage previously used IP.  Configuration\nMake sure that CLI user has SSH key:\nopenstack key list\nCreate SSH key if needed:\nopenstack key create --public-key .ssh/id_rsa.pub ssh_key_name\nCreate ports for your planned servers:\nopenstack port create --network public server-1-port\nopenstack port create --network public server-2-port\nChoose images and flavors for servers: openstack image list\nopenstack flavor list\nCreate servers with corresponding ports:\nopenstack server create \\ --image 'centos-8.2-2004' \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --port server-1-port \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server1 openstack server create \\ --image 'centos-8.2-2004' \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --port server-2-port \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server2 Verify created servers:\nopenstack server list\nopenstack port list\nOptionally:\nInstall Nginx web server on server1 and Apache on server2 and configure Ventus firewall rule to allow TCP port 80 from your workstation:\n Centos:  Server1: yum install nginx systemctl enable nginx systemctl start nginx Server2: yum install httpd\nsystemctl enable httpd\nsystemctl start httpd   Ubuntu:  Server1:\napt update apt install nginx systemctl enable nginx systemctl start nginx Server2:\napt install apache2 systemctl enable apache2 systemctl start apache2 Verify that IP addres of server-1-port is served by nginx webserver and IP addres of server-2-port served by Apache: curl \u0026lt;IP addres of server-1-port\u0026gt; curl \u0026lt;IP addres of server-2-port\u0026gt;    Perform failover.\n Detaching ports from servers:  openstack server remove port \u0026lt;server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;port\u0026gt; openstack server remove port server1 server-1-port openstack server remove port server2 server-2-port  Attaching port of server1 to server2 and vice versa:  openstack server add port \u0026lt;server\u0026gt; \u0026lt;port\u0026gt; openstack server add port server1 server-2-port openstack server add port server2 server-1-port  Reboot servers if needed:  openstack server reboot server1 openstack server reboot server2  Verify that ports were switched:  openstack server list openstack port list Optionally: Verify that IP address of server-1-port is now served by Apache webserver and IP address of server-2-port is now served by Nginx web servers. It will mean that we successfully switched ports of our servers.\ncurl \u0026lt;IP addres of server-1-port\u0026gt; curl \u0026lt;IP addres of server-2-port\u0026gt;\nPro Tips:\n  Use \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;fixed-ip\u0026rdquo; argument during port creation for better control of IP allocation in private networks e.g.:\nopenstack port create --network \u0026lt;network_name\u0026gt; --fixed-ip subnet=\u0026lt;subnet_name\u0026gt;,ip-address=\u0026lt;ip_address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;port_name\u0026gt;\ne.g.:\nopenstack port create --network network1 --fixed-ip subnet=subnet1,ip-address=10.0.0.10 server-1-port\n  You can assign multiple ports to one instance e.g.: openstack server add port server1 server-1-port openstack server add port server1 server-2-port\n  Remove IP address from port: openstack port set --no-fixed-ip \u0026lt;port_id\u0026gt; e.g.:\nopenstack port set --no-fixed-ip 68c763c4-d523-4a47-baf9-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  Assign Desired IP to port:\nopenstack port set --fixed-ip subnet=\u0026lt;subnet_name\u0026gt;,ip-address=\u0026lt;ip_address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;port_id\u0026gt; e.g.:\nopenstack port set --fixed-ip subnet=subnet1,ip-address=10.0.0.10 68c763c4-a293-68f9-anr6-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  Assign multiple IP addresses to one port:\nopenstack port set --fixed-ip subnet=subnet1,ip-address=10.0.0.11 68c763c4-a293-68f9-anr6-XXXXXXXXXXXX openstack port set --fixed-ip subnet=subnet1,ip-address=10.0.0.12 68c763c4-a293-68f9-anr6-XXXXXXXXXXXX\nopenstack port set --fixed-ip subnet=subnet1,ip-address=10.0.0.13 68c763c4-a293-68f9-anr6-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  You can use a custom MAC address for port. Contact support if you need it.\n  This scenario is very complex and heavily affected by OS settings inside instance.\nBinding to MAC addresses in your network configuration tool (Netplan, systemd-networkd, others) can cause networking failure.\nRouting table affected by new/changed network interfaces can cause networking failure.\nFirewalls with strict rules can cause networking failure.\nPlease. test this scenario in advance in Non-production environment.\n Conclusion\nAs you can see, the port modification functionality is very powerful and let you similar functionality with what you can do with physical devices and even beyond that. But as a drawback, it leads to complexity and difficulties in configurations on many levels. We recommend avoiding working directly with ports and consider the usage of more advanced features like Floating IPs and Load Balancers except for cases when you really need it.\nFloating IP Floating IP is an IP address allocated from Public network range by request and associated with specific project. You can assign Floating IP to any of your instances provisioned in private networks. This provides great flexibility in management of your network resources.\nSome of the key advantages provided by Floating IPs:\n Once Floating IP created - it will stay in your project until you explicitly delete it. Regardless if you delete resources to which it attached. It guarantees that you will have your stable static IP for as long as it needed for your infrastructure. You can create multiple Floating IPs per project. You can almost immediately transfer Floating IP from one instance to another without any interruptions to service. Instance itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about Floating IP existence. You don\u0026rsquo;t have additional network interface on OS level. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to care about routing with multiple interfaces.  You need to know that:\n Floating IP can be assigned only to instance provisioned in private network with routing configured. Only one Floating IP can be assigned to instance at one time You can\u0026rsquo;t have Floating IP created from range of your private network. You can leverage Load Balancers to cover this case.  Configuration\nCreate private network:\nopenstack network create private\nCreate and configure subnet:\nopenstack subnet create \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 \\ --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \\ --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 \\ --allocation-pool start=10.0.0.10,end=10.0.0.200 \\ --network private \\ private_subnet Create router to let instances in private network access to internet:\nopenstack router create private_gateway\nConfigure gateway for router:\nopenstack router set --external-gateway public private_gateway\nAttach router to private subnet (enable routing):\nopenstack router add subnet private_gateway private_subnet\nCreate a couple of servers in private network:\nopenstack server create \\ --image 'centos-8.2-2004' \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server1 openstack server create \\ --image 'centos-8.2-2004' \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ server2 Make sure that servers created in private subnet range and you can\u0026rsquo;t connect to it over internet:\nopenstack server list\nCreate floating IP:\nopenstack floating ip create public\nShow list of floating IPs available:\nopenstack floating ip list\nAssign Floating IP to server1:\n#openstack server add floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nVerify that you can connect to server1 over internet using Floating IP address. Make sure that you allowed SSH access on Ventus Firewall - to find more detailed instructions see the article - Firewall Rules:\n#ssh centos@\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nssh centos@88.218.52.5\nReassign Floating IP to server2:\n#openstack server add floating ip server2 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server2 88.218.52.5\nConnect to the same Floating IP over SSH and make sure that you are now accessing server2 instead of server1 using the very same address:\n#ssh centos@\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nssh centos@88.218.52.5\nDelete server2 and verify that Floatin IP still exists in your project and can be reused:\nopenstack server delete server2\nopenstack floating ip list\nAssign Floating IP to server1:\n#openstack server add floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server add floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nopenstack floating ip list\nUnassign Floating IP from Any servers:\n#openstack server remove floating ip server1 \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;\nopenstack server remove floating ip server1 88.218.52.5\nopenstack floating ip list\nConclusion Floating IP is a great addition to your infrastructure. It\u0026rsquo;s simple to use. It let you great flexibility in performing drop-in replacement of instances. It guarantees you the stability of the IP address - once you created it will be yours until explicit termination. It can highly increase your security by running all of your workload inside a private network still being able to access the environment using jump servers with adding Public IP only for a limited time (maintenance) and others.\nLoad Balancer Load balancer is a feature designed to satisfy the needs of the most complex and modern distributed application architectures. It helps to increase the performance of your application by distributing requests over multiple instances based on the chosen algorithm as well as reduce possible interruption to service caused by failed instances by leveraging instance auto-eviction functionality based on health probes.\nConfiguration\nCreate and configure network:\nopenstack network create private openstack subnet create \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 \\ --dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8 \\ --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/24 \\ --allocation-pool start=10.0.0.10,end=10.0.0.200 \\ --network private \\ private_subnet openstack router create private_gateway openstack router set --external-gateway public private_gateway openstack router add subnet private_gateway private_subnet Create a couple of servers in private network so we can test Load Balancer.\nThis time we will leverage User Data a.k.a. Cloud-Init feature for automatic preconfiguration of software inside newly created instance without need to login to it.\nPrepare Cloud-Init config (adjust for your OS Distro accordingly):\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; ./server1.yaml #cloud-config runcmd: - yum install -y nginx - systemctl start nginx EOF cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; ./server2.yaml #cloud-config runcmd: - yum install -y httpd - systemctl start httpd EOF Config of server1.yaml will install and start Nginx webserver on server1. Config of server2.yaml will install and enable Apache web server on server2:\nopenstack server create \\ --image 'centos-8.2-2004' \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ --user-data ./server1.yaml \\ server1 openstack server create \\ --image 'centos-8.2-2004' \\ --boot-from-volume 100 \\ --flavor VC-4 \\ --security-group default \\ --network private \\ --key-name ssh_key_name \\ --user-data ./server2.yaml \\ server2 Now we have two servers with different web servers which listen on the same port. Both of them inside a private network therefore not reachable from the internet.\nCreate Load Balancer\nUse the next command to create Load Balancer:\npenstack loadbalancer create --name web --vip-subnet-id private_subnet\nCreate Load Balancer Listener:\nopenstack loadbalancer listener create \\ --name web_listener \\ --protocol HTTP \\ --protocol-port 80 \\ web Create Load Balancer Pool:\nopenstack loadbalancer pool create \\ --name web_pool \\ --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN \\ --listener web_listener \\ --protocol HTTP Get servers ip:\nopenstack server list +--------------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------------+--------------------------+--------+ | ID | Name | Status | Networks | Image | Flavor | +--------------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------------+--------------------------+--------+ | a1cb4833-c542-4cd4-b980-XXXXXXXXXXX | server2 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.193 | N/A (booted from volume) | VC-4 | | f4bb4bcd-6366-4bcd-83fa-XXXXXXXXXXX | server1 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.19 | N/A (booted from volume) | VC-4 | +--------------------------------------+---------+--------+--------------------+--------------------------+--------+ Add web servers/instances to Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s pool (use your IP addresses):\nopenstack loadbalancer member create \\ --subnet-id private_subnet \\ --address 10.0.0.19 \\ --protocol-port 80 \\ web_pool openstack loadbalancer member create \\ --subnet-id private_subnet \\ --address 10.0.0.193 \\ --protocol-port 80 \\ web_pool Now we have preconfigured instances with installed and enabled web servers, created and configured Load Balancer, but everything is exposed only to internal network, let\u0026rsquo;s fix that by adding Floating IP to our infrastructure:\nopenstack floating ip create public\nGet IP address of Load Balancer listener:\nopenstack loadbalancer list +--------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+ | id | name | project_id | vip_address | provisioning_status | provider | +--------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+ | ae2a65e5-293f-455d-8cb8-XXXXXXXXXXXX | web | 17a1fd0e5a87468da287XXXXXXXXXXXX | 10.0.0.48 | ACTIVE | amphora | +--------------------------------------+------+----------------------------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+ Get Port ID of Load Balancer listener:\nopenstack port list | grep 10.0.0.48 | 71292fef-7a94-43ac-bfe3-XXXXXXXXXXXX | octavia-lb-ae2a65e5-293f-455d-8cb8-XXXXXXXXXXXX | fa:16:3e:XX:XX:XX | ip_address='10.0.0.48', subnet_id='9efbdfb3-f86d-40f0-b07a-XXXXXXXXXXXX ' | DOWN | Assign Previously created Floating IP to Load balancer\u0026rsquo;s Listener port:\nopenstack floating ip set --port 71292fef-7a94-43ac-bfe3-XXXXXXXXXXXX \u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt;  Pro Tips:\nDespite you can create Load Balancer directly in Public network, we highly recommend using of Floating IP\u0026rsquo;s instead. This will dramatically increase your flexibility in upgrade/migration/disaster recovery scenarios but will keep all of the benefits of Load Balancer itself.\n As result we have:\n Internal network with subnet; Router which let instances access to internet; Preconfigured instances with automatically installed web servers; Fully configured Load Balancers with pool members of two web servers; Floating IP attached to Load Balancer which exposes web services to internet over port 80.  Test Load balancer Functionality:\ncurl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; As we configured Load Balancer to work using Round Robin algorithm expected result - different responses on each HTTP request. This means that Load Balancer equally distributes traffic between all pool members.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use curl instead of your Browser for testing purposes because the Browsers caching mechanism can mess results.\n Now let\u0026rsquo;s disable one of the web servers. You can shutdown instance or disable web server.\nExpected result - you will always receive response only from one web server because Load Balancer will automatically detect that backend instance is down.\nRestore your \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; webserver and verify that now you receive results again from both web servers (Apache and Nginx).\nChange Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s algorithm.\nSome applications may benefit from accepting client requests to the same instance instead of distribution across all instances:\nopenstack loadbalancer pool set --lb-algorithm SOURCE_IP web_pool\nVerify that Load Balancer\u0026rsquo;s behavior changed:\ncurl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; curl http://\u0026lt;floating_ip_address\u0026gt; You should always receive results only from the same server.\nSupported LB Algorithms:\n SOURCE_IP; ROUND_ROBIN; LEAST_CONNECTIONS; SOURCE_IP_PORT;  In addition, Load Balancers has a much more broad functionality than it was described above. It supports multiple pools, multiple listeners, SSL offloading, advanced monitors, and other what will be described in Load Balancers dedicated documentation.\nConclusion\nLoad Balancer is a powerful and advanced feature that can enhance multiple aspects of your application starting but not limiting with traffic distribution, fault detection, smooth adding, and removing instances from pools/farms/clusters. In conjunction with private networks, routers, and Floating IP it can become a great entry point for your application.\n"
